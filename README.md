As is written in the description, O-ReShare is an open source file sharing micro platform. This project consists of a back-end side and a front-end side. The back-end is solely responsible for the storage of the files. While the front-end has as 
objective to encrypt the files selected by a user.

Currently the front-end is not already ready (I am working on it).
